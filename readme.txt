This is the code for DynamicBCI. This work was submitted to ubicomp and used as my bachelor thesis. 
Three files are contained in this repository. 
"Asset" rar contains the UI, written in C#, for Unity.
"FBCCA MATLAB" rar contains the FBCCA recognizer for SSVEP signal, with JFPM modulation.
"simulation Matlab" rar contains simulation of DynamicBCI using MATLAB. The model for SSVEP signal was also contained here.

Should you have any questions, please email me at lisiminsimon@buaa.edu.cn or lisiminsimon@gmail.com, I'll be more than happy to help.
