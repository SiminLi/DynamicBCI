This is the code for DynamicBCI, work of dynamically adjusting keyboard layout for better speed of BCI speller. I conduct this work with Dr. Xin Yi (now assistant professor of Tsinghua University). This work was used as my bachelor thesis and supposed to submit to Ubicomp, but finally cancelled because of COVID. Afterwards, a series of changes happens and the progress remains static eversince.

Three files are contained in this repository. 
"Asset" rar contains the UI, written in C#, for Unity.
"FBCCA MATLAB" rar contains the FBCCA recognizer for SSVEP signal, with JFPM modulation.
"simulation Matlab" rar contains simulation of DynamicBCI using MATLAB. The model for SSVEP signal was also contained here.
